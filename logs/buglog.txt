- Issue with the player's health. Through a misunderstanding of the hurt funtion, the player will
be hurt without a invincibility timer. Trying to find a way to not use the hurt function by
trying to make another function that will check if the player is invincible.
RESOLVED: Fixed by having the main game account for this invicibility timer. The game will check
if the player is colliding with an enemy, then check if the player is currently invincible, then apply
damage accordingly (RESOLVED 9/27/2025)

- New bug has appeared: When two enemies collide with the player and the player kills one of the enemies, there
is no damage being done from the other enemy colliding with the player
RESOLVED: Changed up the logic for colliding. Originally, main.js called player.onCollide, and tracking
the current colliding object. Then, onUpdate checked if that colliding element is an enemy.
Now, the logic is changed. player.onCollide is no longer used. The enemy damaged logic
is handled by onUpdate using player.getCollisions, tracking all collisions. The same logic is 
used to track the tags of the colliding element.
