- Issue with the player's health. Through a misunderstanding of the hurt funtion, the player will
be hurt without a invincibility timer. Trying to find a way to not use the hurt function by
trying to make another function that will check if the player is invincible.
RESOLVED: Fixed by having the main game account for this invicibility timer. The game will check
if the player is colliding with an enemy, then check if the player is currently invincible, then apply
damage accordingly (RESOLVED 9/27/2025)
